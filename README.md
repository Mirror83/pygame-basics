# Pygame Basics

This is a small game created with the intention of learning the fundamentals of 
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). This is from the 
[YouTube tutorial by Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk) 

The main logic is from the video, but the code in this repository has some minor
differences compared to the one in the video.

The game is similar to the Chrome Dinosaur game that becomes available when there is no
Internet in Google Chrome.
